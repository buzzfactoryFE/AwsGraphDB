# AWS Objects in Neo4j

In the AWS Cloud often is not easy keep under control your objects like EC2, VPNs, Transiti Gateway Attachments, vpc peering, security groups and so on, especially
when you are working with multiple accounts and vpcs spread across all over the world. the mistake is always behind the corner.
Graph databases are the best tool to use to keep relationships under control and identify relationships that shouldn' exist and can compromize your security.
This project uses Neo4j Desktop , Cloud Custion and pyhton scripts to load data gathered using Custion into Neo4j database for analisys.
